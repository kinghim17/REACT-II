const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
A state is a JavaScript object managed within a React component that holds dynamic data. 
It allows React components to manage and react to changes in their data.
count is the state variable that stores the current value of the counter.
setCount is a state updater function that is used to update the value of count.
useState(0) initializes the count state to 0.

What is the Dependency Array?
The dependency array is the second argument passed to the useEffect hook.
It tells React when to re-run the effect.
Based on the values in the array, React determines whether the effect should run again after the component re-renders.

You use useEffect for tasks like:

Fetching data (e.g., from an API).
Directly interacting with the DOM (e.g., adding event listeners).
Running timers (e.g., setTimeout or setInterval).
Cleaning up resources (e.g., removing event listeners, canceling network requests)
4:
seCallback is a React hook that returns a memoized version of a function. It ensures the function reference stays the same between renders unless its dependencies change.
This is useful when passing functions to child components or using them in useEffect
